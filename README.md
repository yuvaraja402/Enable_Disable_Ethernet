# Enable or Disable Ethernet :globe_with_meridians:

<b>Motivation</b> :thought_balloon: - In <i>Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10</i> there is always a hassle when there is a need to disconnect ethernet port during maintenance tasks or performing company's confidential work that shouldn't be connected to the internet at any costs. A person has to physically remove the ethernet cable or perform multiple clicks to disable the ethernet ports functioning. <i>Enabling and disabling wifi has never been easier, but Ethernet port has been a hassle always!</i>

<b>Objective</b> :dart: - An user interface that will perform enabling and disabling of ethernet port whenever required saving multiple clicks and time.
